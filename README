each document must contain one root node (html) with an optional "base"
attribute
if the "base" attribute is present, then the specified file will be processed
first, then each child of the root node containing one of the following
attributes:

    replace, append, prepend, before, after, surround, merge

will be inserted into a copy of the base document, in a manner determined by
which attribute is used. The value of the attribute should be an xpath
targetting the node in the base document to be replaced etc. If multiple nodes
are targeted the action will be performed for each of them.

replace:
    Replace the matched node with this one.
    The "keep-contents" attribute can be set to "true" to indicate that the
    contents of the original node should be appended to this node after
    replacement.
append:
    Insert this node at the end of the matched node.
prepend:
    Insert this node at the start of the matched node.
before:
    Insert this node before the matched node.
after:
    Insert this node after the matched node.
surround:
    Insert this node as a sibling of the matched node then move the matched node
    into this node.
    The "where" attribute can be set to "top" or "bottom" to indicate if the
    target node should be placed before or after the contents of this node (if
    any).
    If the "where" attribute is omitted the target node will be placed after the
    contents of this node.
merge:
    Copy the attributes of this node onto the target node, replacing any
    existing attributes. The contents of this node are ignored.
remove:
    Remove the targetted node. The type, attributes and contents of this node
    are ignored.

directives are processed in order, and the results of an earlier directive can
be targetted by a later directive, for example:

base.html:
<html>
    <body>
        <div id="master">...</div>
    </body>
</html>

override.html:
<html base="base.html">
    <div id="wrap" surround="//*[@id='master']"></div>
    <div id="wrap-moar" surround="//*[@id='wrap']"></div>
</html>

result for override.html:
<html>
    <body>
        <div id="wrap-moar">
            <div id="wrap">
                <div id="master">...</div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>

thus it follows that you cannot replace a node then later target the replaced
node
